# Pattern recogntion project

This is the project for the course CSI5107(Pattern recogntion). In this project, we implemented and tested various classifiers such as Naive Bayes, LR, KNN with numpy from scratch. The results such as decion boundaries and the performances on test datasets can be found on project.ipynb

The experiment.py file contains the classifier.
